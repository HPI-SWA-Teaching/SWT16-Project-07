This factory is used to execute an older version of the Readme.md that was on github. When the team in 2018 got the project none of that readme worked. So we started with testing it and slowly fixing all the bugs. This Factory now is our general way of setting up a very barebone acceptance test instance. You can use it by executing ACReadMeFactory executeReadMe but don't forget to use ACReadMeFactory tearDown. At the end of your tests otherwise you will have leftover classes in your system.
